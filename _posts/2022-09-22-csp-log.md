Welcome to my APCSP Blog!

Here is where I will document my learning in AP Computer Science Principles every week!

Week 1
I downloaded all the tools and equipment needed for this class
I learned basic cs vocabulary such as input, output, sequence, and key/value
I learned Python Linux commands (pwd, cd, mkdirr, ls)
I learned how to make markdown posts and jupyter notebooks
I used Python to create a 6-question quiz
I used a jupyter notebook to write code that checks to see if I have the right packages installed (Bash)
I searched up by myself how to make my website have a background color and text-align the title in the middle
I made a study guide I can update throughout the year for all of my classes
# Week 2
