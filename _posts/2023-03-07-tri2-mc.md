Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an access security product used to verify a user's identity at login. It adds two or more identity-checking steps to user logins by use of secure authentication tools. 

When a user enters an incorrect password more than two times in a row and gets locked out. This is not double authentication because only one password is inputted and checks for whether its accurate rather than checking for the identity of the user twice. All other choices offer two ways of identification.

I misunderstood this question. To do better next time, I could take more time to think about the question and logic it through more thoroughly.

This question is about algorithms. Better to think through the logic and approach the problem slowly. 

3.6 Notes

- algorithms: a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task
- Example: Updating the High Score
    1. Set highScore to 10.
    2. Get currentScore from user.
    3. If currentScore is greater than highScore, set highScore to currentScore.
