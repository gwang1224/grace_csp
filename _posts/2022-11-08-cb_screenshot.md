Using Jupyter Notebook, I was able to visualize the code better with an actual output. I thought that having y = False would print "False" but if the if-statement was false, the statement would not print anything.

The code first obtains the first index of the list using the variable j. Then it gets another variable k in order to index the other numbers in the rest of the list. The index of the list include len(myList) - 1. The second while loop repeats while changing k and comparing it to the myList(j). The while loop goes on until all the values in the list are looped through.

Again, I used Jupyter Notebook to visualize the code. I did not realize that the thirdList had been set to firstList. Then, because secondList was set in thirdList, the secondList = firstList.
