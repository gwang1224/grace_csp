## My Life ðŸ¤ª

### Friday 8/26/2022
I woke up late and my mom got mad at me. I got to school and did a physics lab. Then I went to Calculus BC and got yelled at by my math teacher for being too slow and not being ready at the start of class (even though the bell didn't ring yet ðŸ™„). While doing classwork, I got scolded for being an "independent contractor". We had extra time at the end of class but I didn't bring my math paper to do homework so I sat there for 20 minutes and contemplated my life choices. Rest of the day was fine. I went Starbucks after school and did some homework. Then I went to Sprouts and bought some sushi and found my dad. My friend and I went to my house and ate our sushi then went to the football game. I'm not a big football fan but its fun to watch. However, these pesky freshmen and sophomores were pushing and spraying silly string everywhere and being annoying. Some junior whacked two sophomores with a spiky bouncy ball and it was really funny. We left and went to Target because we were getting bored. My ankles and knees hurt but it was fun :)

### Sunday 8/28/2022
I had a nightmare last night and woke up crying. However, my memory was completely wiped of my nightmare so I was crying in the middle of the night for no reason. I passed out right after and woke up this morning very confused. I should see a therapist.
