2. Talk about dopamine issues. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
    - Dopamine issues surrounding happiness felt from social media is an issue. Because some people feel fulfilled with the entertainment provided by social media. They can become addicted. I have avoided this problem of social media addiction by deleting Instagram and Snapchat on my phone. However, I do understand how people can get addicted to their computers which would lead to detrimental personal study habits and success. Watching Youtube videos or scrolling through Instagram does give me a brief rush of dopamine at the end of the day when I have finished all my work so it does not waste my time.
