Our project at night at the museum was Taylor Swift album encyclopedia. 

Our team had the most trouble with the backend and connecting it to the frontend. I was the DevOps of the team and also worked on backend and frontend. I created the backend files which are accessible by the link http://musicmania.nighthawkcodescrums.gq/api/music/taylor and http://musicmania.nighthawkcodescrums.gq/api/music/like/"album".

Although we were able to make the backend, we were unable to connect the backend to the front end using fetch commands and JavaScript. The main problem was that our team did not know how to code in JavaScript. This is an aspect we can improve on next trimester.

At Night at the Museum, we presented our project to multiple parents, Mr. Mort, and Mr. Yeung. While we were presenting, many people were not Taylor Swift fans or knew of her songs. Thus, next time, we could develop a website that could appeal to a wider demographic, such as including more music options and more artists.
