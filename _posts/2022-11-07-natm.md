Our team learned a lot from our Night at the Museum presentation. First, I learned be more mindful when closing doors and will be sure I will not accidentally lock Claire in the sound booth again.

Our project was on the Taylor Swift albums. While we were presenting our project, many people did know Taylor Swift's albums or liked her songs.
