Most of my scoring was consistent to Collegeboard's scoring. The project was simple, but most of the requirements could be fulfilled except for the managing complexity. If the student had described the function right, they could have gotten a better score. I also need learn about the difference between function and purpose as they are very similar and I want to avoid making the same mistakes as this student did in the project.

My scoring compared to Collegeboard scoring was the same. I thought this student's project was very cool. I don't know how to use Scratch but it may be useful for me if I used it in my performance task. Also, since this student was able to describe the function and purpose right, I understand how to describe the function and purpose now.
