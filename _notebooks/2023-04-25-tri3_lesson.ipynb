    "In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the 'MPG' column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the 'MPG' column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently"

    "#### Summary/Goals of Lesson:\n",
    "One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players.\n",

    "What is NumPy and how is it used in data analysis?\n",
    "- NumPy is a python library that makes it easy to perform data analysis. It makes it easier to make arrays and calculate significant statistical values using these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Pandas and how is it used in data analysis?\n",
    "- Pandas library provides code that allows for easier data manipulation. This can also calculate statistical scores and create data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is NumPy different than Pandas for data analysis?\n",
    "- NumPy is a library for scientific computing and supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Pandas offers data manipulation tools such as data cleaning, merging, filtering, and grouping, as well as statistical functions and time-series analysis. Overall, NumPy is more focused on numerical computations, while Pandas is more suited for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a DataFrame?\n",
    "- A dataframe is a 2D array of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some common operations you can perform with NumPy?\n",
    "- create arrays\n",
    "- indexing\n",
    "- mathematical operations\n",
    "- statistical analysis (mean, mode, etc)\n",
    "- counting\n",
    "\n",
    "How Can You Incorporate Either of these Data Analysis Tools (NunPy, Pandas) into your project?\n",
    "- I could incorporate Pandas by doing data analysis on user inputted data. Since my CSP is gathering scores from a quiz, I could use Pandas to analyze the scores, such as mean, mode, or creating a graph.\n",
