<p>Aadya’s group worked on a website for organizing Del Norte Clubs.</p>

<p>I really like the aesthetics of Sarayu’s project and their idea. They created a website for discovering asian foods. I like how their project promotes diversity and can help people explore new cultures and their foods.</p>

<p>These were so cool! I thought they were pictures at first but then I realized this was animation. The donuts looked very real and looked very scrumptious.</p>

<h3 id="photography">Photography</h3>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1068416415251570689/1079971936613965834/IMG_9838.jpg" width="500" height="600" /></p>

<p>I liked this picture of Del Norte with the sunset. I don’t usually stay at school that late to see the sunset so this was a really nice moment to be able to experience through the picture.</p>

<p>This describes my mental state during finals week although I would not eat that dead bird.</p>

<p>This was my favorite art piece. I’ve seen this on TikTok and its a really cool plant waterer. I thought it was so cool that they could make this.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1068416415251570689/1079972075944562748/IMG_9397.jpg" width="500" height="600" /></p>

<p>This one was very realistic, I though it was real wood but then I remembered I was in ceramics and realized it wasn’t wood.</p>

<p>I forgot to take photos but there was a really nice film about someone’s two cats.</p>
